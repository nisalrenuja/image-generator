# AI Image Generation Project

This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in generating realistic images based on user preferences. By using the OpenAI API, we can create an interactive web application that allows users to input specific criteria or ideas and have the AI generate corresponding images.

Features
- AI Image Generation: Utilize the OpenAI API to generate high-quality images based on user input.
- User-friendly Interface: The front-end, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, offers a seamless user experience.
- Scalable Back-end: The back-end, powered by Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, ensures a robust and scalable environment for managing user interactions and data storage.
- Image Storage: Store generated images in Cloudinary to access and display them later.
- Customization: Allow users to fine-tune the generated images by adjusting specific parameters.
